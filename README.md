# peerstreamit-app
Android application that fragments mp4s and streams them to the server

The server-side components can be found here: https://github.com/mikep175/peerstreamit-web

This allows for the streaming of videos from a mobile device to a remote web browser without storing the video on a server.

Android -> Proxy Websocket Service -> HTML5 Video Player
